# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer

Python program made with kivy library for visualizing different sorting algorithms. A problem that many students face while learning sorting algorithms is how to visualize them, so this project will help them get an easy understanding of different sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms

The sorting algorithms implemented in this project are:
 - Bubble Sort
 - Quick Sort
 - Merge Sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Selection Sort
 - Radix Sort (LSD)
